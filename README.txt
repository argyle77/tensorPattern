Tensor pattern generation - Version 1.0.0 -  Brief tensor / SDL demo - red / mod

These patterns output as UDP to the tensor wall.  There is a preview window
using SDL.

Build instructions:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

Binaries can be found in build/bin.

There are two orphaned binaries in the bin directory.  The code that produced
them doesn't seem to exist anymore.
