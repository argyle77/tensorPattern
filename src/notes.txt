TODO:

For the enum values, have two arrays, one for display name (exists), one for save file name.
Ability to use either enum values from files or their mnemonics.


Design notes:
There are two frame buffers.  One is the broadcast (live) buffer, and the other
is the background (alt) buffer.
At each simulation step, the selected transform set is executed on the selected 
frame buffer.

Transform sets consist of lists of transforms to perform on a frame buffer in
order.  Each list item consists of a function name, version number, parameters.
The parameters will include both startup data and internal function state data
(as necessary) and will be parsed (from files) according to the version number.
Internal function state data allows us to resume processing of a function across
program restarts, as well as ?
