Tensor ip address map. To use this map, rename the file to tensorIP.map. Lines
beginning with anything other than a digit are considered a comment. 18 IP
addresses are expected.  Each group of 6 corresponds to a panel.  The file 
tensorIP.map.default shows the defaults used if no alternate map is found. Any
characters other than a digit, comma, or space, will cause the rest of the
line to be ignored.  The order of the addresses matters.  The section headings
below are non functional comments.  Don't start a comment line with a digit.
